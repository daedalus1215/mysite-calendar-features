# mysite-calendar-features

This module works in tandem with the content creation page of the content type Event Items. When a calendar editor 
is creating new events and selects an event type that has "Training" of any kind in it, we 
want to make sure we check off the "All: Training" check box, this will allow us to do 
a better filter search on the calendar search page. Now we can just select "All: Training" 
and get every Event Type that is some sort of "Training."
